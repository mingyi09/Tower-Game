# Course Assignment: Tower Game
### An Overview from the Writeup
A demo of gameplay of a simple RPG. In the game, there is the hero, our main character, and the tower. 
In each level of the tower, there is a monster and an item. 
The hero will go from the first level to the top level of the tower, fighting a monster at each level along the way. Once a monster is defeated, the hero will pick up an item on the same level to enhance themselves. Both hero and monsters have three attributes: attackDamage, health, and speed. The hero and monster will take turns attacking each other.
The attackDamage indicates the amount of damage the hero or monster will cause to their opponent (i.e., drop their health) in each turn. 
One of them is defeated once their health drops to 0 (or less). Speed determines which side attacks first (higher speed attacks first). 
The hero wins when the monster on the top level is defeated. Whenever the hero is defeated, itâ€™s game over.
